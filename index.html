           <h3>I am an incoming student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and I love learning new things. I am intereted in computer science, math, physics, and astronomy.
               For the past three years, I have been taking courses in CS including Web programming, Python programming, Algorithms, and Machine Learning. 
               I am currently mastering JavaScript to start my journey in app development using ReactNative. 
               I plan to implement the Machine Learning algorithms I learned, neural networks specifically, on my application and make something impactful. Furthermore, I am curious to learn about phenomenon out there in the unvierse. One of the things that tickles my head is Dark Matter, and I want research it in the coming future.
